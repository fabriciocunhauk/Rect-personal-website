            <p>I'm a Self-taught JavaScript full-stack developer passionate about technology and the future of the world.
            From the moment I produced "Hello World" in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into
            the world of software development. But software development has never been "just a job" for me, it's offered an
            engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What's started
            with a simple "Hello World" has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exiting as time goes by.
